# Mobs

This document will detail the various non-player characters (mobs) that players might encounter in the game. This includes neutral mobs and hostile mobs.

## Overview
Mobs will primarily feature in the Arena map and potentially other future game modes. They can serve various purposes:
-   Provide PvE challenges.
-   Create dynamic elements in PvP encounters.
-   Drop resources or power-ups.

## Mob Types (Examples - To Be Designed)

### Neutral Mobs
These mobs might not be initially aggressive but could react if attacked or if certain conditions are met.
-   **Example Type 1: Scavenger Critter**
    -   Behavior: Roams the map, avoids players unless cornered.
    -   Physics: Fast, erratic movement. Low health.
    -   Drops: Minor resources.

### Hostile Mobs
These mobs will actively seek out and attack players.
-   **Example Type 1: Lesser Imp**
    -   Behavior: Aggressive, attacks on sight. Simple melee or ranged attack.
    -   Physics: Medium speed, direct pursuit.
    -   Stats: Low to medium health and damage.
-   **Example Type 2: Hulking Brute**
    -   Behavior: Slow but powerful. Area-of-effect attacks.
    -   Physics: Slow movement, high mass/knockback resistance.
    -   Stats: High health, high damage.

## Mob Physics Profiles
Similar to player classes, mobs will have their own physics profiles determining their movement characteristics:
-   Base Movement Speed
-   Acceleration Rate
-   Turn Rate
-   Aggro Range
-   Attack Range
-   (Other AI-related parameters)
