# UI Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for implementing User Interface (UI) elements in the game.

## Core Principles
-   **In-Game HUD & World Elements:** For UI elements that are tightly integrated with the game world (e.g., player health bars above characters, floating damage text, simple status indicators), Phaser's built-in rendering capabilities (BitmapText, Graphics objects, DOM Elements managed by Phaser) will be prioritized for performance and ease of integration with game coordinates.
-   **Complex Overlay Menus & Screens:** For more complex, traditional UI screens that overlay the game (e.g., Main Menu, Settings, Character Selection, Inventory, Shop, Leaderboards, Lobby), the plan is to leverage a dedicated web UI framework.

## Chosen Framework for Complex UI (Future Implementation)
-   **React:** It is anticipated that React will be used for building these complex UI overlays.
    -   **Rationale:**
        -   Provides a robust component-based architecture for building maintainable and scalable UIs.
        -   Offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
        -   Allows for a clear separation between game logic (Phaser) and UI logic (React).
        -   Many developers have experience with React, potentially easing future team collaboration.

## Implementation Approach (Phaser + React)
-   The Phaser game will run in its primary `<canvas>` element.
-   The React application will render its components into a separate DOM container, typically layered above the Phaser canvas.
-   Communication between Phaser and React will be managed via:
    -   A shared event bus (e.g., a simple `Phaser.Events.EventEmitter` instance accessible by both).
    -   Potentially a lightweight global state management solution if complexity warrants it.
    -   Direct function calls where appropriate (e.g., React UI calls a function exposed by the Phaser game instance).

## Phased Implementation
-   **Stage 1 (Sandbox):** UI needs are minimal. Phaser's built-in text objects are sufficient for basic instructions and debug information. No React integration is planned for this stage.
-   **Later Stages (Arena, Polishing, Full Game):** As the need for complex menus and UI screens arises, React will be integrated. This might start with the Main Menu, Lobby, or a settings screen.

## Key Considerations
-   **Performance:** Ensure that the React UI overlay does not negatively impact the performance of the Phaser game canvas.
-   **State Synchronization:** Carefully manage how game state is communicated to the React UI and how UI actions are communicated back to the game to avoid inconsistencies.
-   **Build Process:** The Webpack configuration will need to be adapted to handle both the Phaser game (TypeScript) and the React application (JSX/TSX) if they are part of the same build pipeline, or they could be separate micro-frontends. For now, we assume they will be integrated into the existing client build.
